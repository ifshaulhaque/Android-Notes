Of course. It's a great time to be an Android developer with 3 years of experience. The ecosystem has matured significantly, and your experience will be highly valued. Here is a comprehensive syllabus tailored for your interview preparation, focusing on modern Android development (Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, etc.) while ensuring you have a strong grasp of fundamentals.

### Guiding Philosophy for Your Preparation:

- **Depth over Breadth:** For a 3-year role, interviewers expect you to go beyond definitions. They want to know the "why" behind your choices.
    
- **Think Aloud:** During problem-solving, explain your thought process. It demonstrates your analytical skills.
    
- **Project Review:** Be prepared to walk through your most complex project in extreme detail. Be ready to defend your architectural and technology choices.
    
- **Modern Android Development (MAD):** This is no longer a "nice-to-have." Expertise in Jetpack libraries, Coroutines/Flow, and modern app architecture is now the baseline expectation.

### The 4-6 Week Interview Preparation Syllabus

#### **Week 1-2: Core Android & Kotlin Mastery**

This is about solidifying your foundation. Don't skip this, even if you think you know it.

- **Kotlin (Advanced Concepts):**
    
    - **Concurrency:** Coroutines (``launch`,`async/await`,`supervisorScope`), Flows (`StateFlow`,`SharedFlow`), Channels. Understand structured concurrency, coroutine context and dispatchers (IO, Default, Main).
        
    - **Functional Programming:** `map`, `filter`, `fold`, `reduce`, `flatMap`.
        
    - **OOP & Keywords:** `inner` vs `nested` classes, `sealed` vs `enum` classes, `inline`, `crossinline`, `noinline`, `reified` types, property delegates (`lazy`, `by`).
        
    - **DSAs in Kotlin:** Practice solving problems using Kotlin's standard library (very common in interviews).
        
- **Android Fundamentals (Deep Dive):**
    
    - **Activity & Fragment Lifecycle:** Not just the callbacks, but how they behave during configuration changes, and how ViewModel fits in.
        
    - **View System:** How measure/layout/draw works, custom views, `ViewBinding` vs `findViewById`.
        
    - **Intents & Deep Links:** Explicit vs Implicit Intents, intent filters.
        
    - **Background Work:** WorkManager (the modern solution), its constraints and guarantees. Understand when to use it vs a simple coroutine.
        

#### **Week 3: Modern Architecture & Jetpack**

This is the heart of modern Android interviews.

- **App Architecture:**
    
    - **MVVM & MVI:** Be able to explain them in detail. For MVI, understand the unidirectional data flow (State + Event -> ViewModel -> State).
        
    - **Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture:** Understand the concepts of layers (Presentation, Domain, Data) and dependency rule.
        
    - **Repository Pattern:** Why is it used? How does it abstract data sources (Network, Database)?
        
- **Android Jetpack (Expert Level):**
    
    - **ViewModel:** Lifetime, how it survives configuration changes, best practices for initialization.
        
    - **Room:** Database creation, `@Entity`, `@Dao`, migrations, testing.
        
    - **DataStore:** Preferences vs Proto DataStore. Migrating from `SharedPreferences`.
        
    - **Paging 3:** How it works with Kotlin Flow, `RemoteMediator` for network + db.
        
    - **Navigation Component:** Navigating with graphs, safe args, deep linking.
        

#### **Week 4: Jetpack Compose & UI**

Compose is now the default UI toolkit. You _must_ be proficient in it.

- **Jetpack Compose:**
    
    - **Core Concepts:** Composable functions, state hoisting, recomposition, state vs remember.
        
    - **State Management:** Using `mutableStateOf`, `remember`, `ViewModel` with Compose.
        
    - **Layouts:** `Column`, `Row`, `Box`, `Modifier` system (deep dive).
        
    - **Theming:** Material Theme 3, custom design systems.
        
    - **Performance:** Identifying and fixing recomposition skips, using `derivedStateOf`.
        
    - **Interoperability:** How to use Compose in a View-based app and vice-versa.
        
- **Advanced UI/UX:**
    
    - **Animations:** Both in View system (``ObjectAnimator`,`ValueAnimator`) and Compose (`animate*AsState`,`Transition`).
        
    - **Accessibility (a11y):** `contentDescription`, `clickable` vs `onClick`, navigation, testing.
        

#### **Week 5: Networking, Dependency Injection, & Testing**

- **Networking:**
    
    - **Retrofit:** Creating APIs, using converters, handling different HTTP methods and status codes.
        
    - **Serialization:** `kotlinx.serialization` vs Gson vs Moshi. Why is Moshi often preferred?
        
    - **REST API Concepts:** HTTP methods, status codes, headers, authentication (tokens, OAuth).
        
- **Dependency Injection (DI):**
    
    - **Hilt (Primary Focus):** Why DI? How Hilt works, `@Inject`, `@Module`, `@Provides`, `@Binds`, scoping (`@ActivityScoped`, `@ViewModelInject`).
        
    - **Dagger 2:** Understand the basics, as Hilt is built on top of it.
        
- **Testing:**
    
    - **Unit Tests:** JUnit, Mockito/Kotlin, `Truth`/`AssertJ` for assertions. Testing ViewModels, Use Cases, Repositories.
        
    - **Instrumented Tests:** Espresso (for Views) and Compose UI testing (`createComposeRule`).
        
    - **Test Architecture:** How to structure your code for testability (using DI, interfaces).
        

#### **Week 6: System Design, Performance, & Behavioral**

- **System Design (For Android):**
    
    - **Approach:** You will be asked to design an app (e.g., "Design a photo-sharing app like Instagram").
        
    - **Think About:** Screen list, navigation graph, data flow, data layer structure (local vs remote), caching strategy, image loading, modularization.
        
    - **Key Buzzwords:** Offline-first, caching, pagination, modularization (dynamic feature modules).
        
- **Performance:**
    
    - **Identifying Issues:** Using Android Studio Profiler (CPU, Memory, Energy).
        
    - **Common Problems:** Memory leaks (and identifying them with the Memory Profiler), UI jank, battery drain, network inefficiency.
        
    - **Solutions:** LeakCanary, optimizing lists (RecyclerView/`LazyColumn`), efficient image loading (Coil/Glide).
        
- **Behavioral Questions:**
    
    - Prepare STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) stories for:
        
        - A challenging bug you fixed.
            
        - A time you disagreed with a teammate/tech lead.
            
        - A project you are most proud of.
            
        - How you handle tight deadlines.
            
        - How you learn new technologies.
            
    - **Have Questions for Them:** Always have 3-5 thoughtful questions about the team, culture, tech challenges, and product roadmap.

    - **Tech Stack:** Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines/Flow, Hilt, Room, Retrofit, MVVM/MVI.
        
    - **Focus on:** Clean architecture, testing, and performance.
        
2. **Practice Coding:**
    
    - **Leetcode / HackerRank:** Easy & Medium problems. Focus on Kotlin.
        
    - **Android-Specific Questions:** Practice on sites like [https://www.tryexponent.com/](https://www.tryexponent.com/) (formerly Byte by Byte).
        
3. **Mock Interviews:** Practice with a friend or use platforms like Pramp. Get comfortable talking through code.
    
4. **Stay Updated:**
    
    - Read the **Android Developers Blog**.
        
    - Watch latest Google I/O videos, especially the "What's new in Android" and deep dives on Compose/Performance.
